## What Is Einpunk Protocol (EinpunkUSD)?

Einpunk Protocol is a decentralized application platform designed to make apps usable on the web. The network runs on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Nightshade, which aims to offer scalability and stable fees.

Einpunk is the native utility token that is used for:

* Fees for processing transactions and storing data.
